3 things need to do:
Change XML Files: 
	Need to write something that on mass changes the weapon xml files to have zero shield damage, a new modifier
	Need to write something that on mass changes the weapon xml files to have zero armor damage, a new modifier
		Assign weapons the shield damage and armor damage they need
	Remove emp damage type from all projectiles that are not mortars 
Modify Rimworld Source:
	Modify shield damage for non-emp damage types to check for shield damage instead of just normal damage and apply that
	modify armor damage to be applied instead of .25 percent of normal damage
Modify Armor:
	I dont really know what to do with marine armor, probably give it a special tag in the xml file that we pull to see if it has shield or not
