3 things need to do:
Change XML Files: 
	Need to write something that on mass changes the weapon xml files to have zero shield damage, a new modifier
	Need to write something that on mass changes the weapon xml files to have zero armor damage, a new modifier
		Assign weapons the shield damage and armor damage they need
	Remove emp damage type from all projectiles that are not mortars 
Modify Rimworld Source:
	Modify shield damage for non-emp damage types to check for shield damage instead of just normal damage and apply that
	modify armor damage to be applied instead of .25 percent of normal damage
Modify Armor:
	I dont really know what to do with marine armor, probably give it a special tag in the xml file that we pull to see if it has shield or not
	


Structure With Mind for the Future:


okay the best possible solution i could come up with is that we would use a xml class to extend the damage def to include armor and shield damage,
this will to not be a class that inherits from the damagedef, but just a class that contains fields for the two parameters of armor damage and shield damage
we will connect these classes through some sort of id, which will probably be just being identical to the damage defs name

Plan figure out how to access a def inside of the code, such that we can find our extension def mentioned above
